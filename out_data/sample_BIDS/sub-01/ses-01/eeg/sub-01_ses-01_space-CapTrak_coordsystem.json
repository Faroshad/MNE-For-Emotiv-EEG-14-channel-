The Y-axis goes orthogonally to the X-axis through the nasion (NAS). The Z-axis goes orthogonally to the XY-plane through the vertex of the head. This corresponds to a \"RAS\" orientation with the origin of the coordinate system approximately between the ears. See Appendix VIII in the BIDS specification.",
